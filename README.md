# Trulia Page
![Trulia](images/trulia.png)

## Objectives
- Combine CSS Grid with Flexbox.
- Deeply nest HTML elements.
- Use classes with your CSS.
- Style a full website from start to finish.
- **Bonus:** Plan cross-device compatibility.

## Rebuild a Page From Trulia
Now you're stepping into the big leagues -- you'll be rebuilding part of a real website: trulia.com

We'll still give you content, colors, and fonts like the last assignment but this is much more difficult.  You'll need to consider how to create this layout before diving in.

## Things To Consider
- Figure out the right semantic structure for your document.  This is hard for a complex, real world site!
- Think how you could use grid and flexbox together and experiment.

### BONUS:  Things To Consider
- Make this responsive.  Phones and tablets get one column, small desktops get two columns, and big desktops get three columns.
- Try to create a responsive navigation structure too. Don't worry about hiding menus yet -- that will come later.

## Technical Requirements
Your solution should include every part of the provided site:
- Navigation menu
- Twelve listing elements in a 3x4 grid (CSS Grid is recommended for this part of the layout)
- Pagination and bread crumbs links
- Bottom Page copy ("Real Estate Insights")
- Footer

## When Is It Due?
